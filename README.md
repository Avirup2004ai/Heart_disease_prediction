This project is focused on building a machine learning model to predict heart disease using a preprocessed heart dataset. The dataset contains various health indicators that are useful for determining the likelihood of heart disease.

## Models and Accuracy

We have implemented multiple classification algorithms to predict heart disease, with the following accuracy scores:

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: 68.85%
- **Decision Trees**: 81.97%
- **Logistic Regression**: 85.25%
- **Naive Bayes**: 85.25%
- **Random Forests**: 88.52%

Among the models, Random Forests performed the best, achieving an accuracy of 88.52%.

## Key Features

- Data preprocessing included handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical data.
- Multiple machine learning algorithms were tested to compare performance.
- Final model was evaluated using accuracy as the primary metric.
